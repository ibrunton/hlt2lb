# hlt2lb
A simple C program to format herbstluftwm's tag_status output for
[lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar).

This is By Me For Me code.

It assumes that the tags in herbstluftwm are named with single characters,
but it could easily be modified to allow for strings instead.

It also assumes only one monitor.
